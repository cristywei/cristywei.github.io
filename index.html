    <div class="title">About</div><br>
    Hello! My name is Cristy. I am currently a data analytics engineer intern at Dreamhaven, based in Irvine, CA. I recieved my BA in Data Science and Economics from Claremont McKenna College in May 2023. <br>

<br>

    My interests lie in the applications of data engineering, software engineering, and analytics to the media, entertainment, and arts industries. I am particularly interested in the development and analysis of game economies on core gameplay mechanics. <br>
    
<br>

    At my time at CMC, I was involved with the College Programming Board, where I oversaw the PR and marketing team, Asian Pacific American Students Association, where I worked with the events marketing team, and 1Gen, where I helped fellow first-generation college students navigate career and post-graduate opportunities. I also tutored for Harvey Mudd College's CS 5 Introduction to Computer Science course. This past summer, I was an engineer intern at Samba TV, working with pipeline efficiency and development. <br>

        <div class="project">Human-Chess Engine Interaction – <a href="https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cmc_theses/3124/l">Scholarship @ Claremont</a></div>
        An examination of how modern-day chess engines have changed the landscape of player self-analysis. Aims to explore the impact of chess engines on player strategies and accuracy by modeling grandmaster centipawn loss over time. Also provides an overview on the development of chess engines, from its roots in WWII crytography to the current era of computer science, and addresses efforts to cull cheating in chess in association with engine use. (Access to the full thesis is restricted; shoot me an email if you would like a copy!) <br><br>
    
    <div class="project">Mastermind in the Terminal – <a href="https://github.com/cristywei/mastermind-cs5-final">Github</a></div>
    This project served as the capstone of HMC's CS 5 course. It allows the user to play the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind</a> in the terminal against a computer AI. Both roles are available for the player to choose from. As a "codemaker," the AI is able to respond to human input, allowing the player to know the accuracy of their guesses. As the "codebreaker," the AI is able to keep track of previous guesses, and actively adjusts its guesses depending on player responses. As the code is stored within the game, the AI is also able to prevent cheating and will reject human responses when lying about the accuracy of a guess, although it will otherwise continue to play as if it doesn't know the code.<br><br>
